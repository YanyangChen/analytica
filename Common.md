 * The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas,
  are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one
  compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second
  is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together,
  and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at
  once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of
  relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that
  accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction,
  and thus all its general ideas are made.

—John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)

* Real-world programming, however, requires
  care, expertise, and wisdom. A small bug in a computer-aided design
  program, for example, can lead to the catastrophic collapse of an airplane
  or a dam or the self-destruction of an industrial robot.
  
* Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:
   - - - -
  **primitive expressions**, which represent the simplest entities the language
   is concerned with,
   - - - -
  **means of combination**, by which compound elements are built from
   simpler ones, and
   - - - -
  **means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and
  manipulated as units.

 * Container — a running instance that encapsulates required software. Containers are always created from images. **A container can expose ports and volumes to interact with other containers or/and the outer world. Containers can be easily killed / removed and re-created again in a very short time. Containers don’t keep state.**
 * Image — **the basic element for every container. When you create an image, every step is cached and can be reused (Copy On Write model). Depending on the image, it can take some time to build.** Containers, on the other hand, can be started from images right away.
 * Port — **a TCP/UDP port in its original meaning. To keep things simple, let’s assume that ports can be exposed to the outer world (accessible from the host OS) or connected to other containers** — i.e., accessible only from those containers and invisible to the outer world.
 * Volume — can be described as a shared folder. **Volumes are initialized when a container is created. Volumes are designed to persist data, independent of the container’s lifecycle.** Registry — the server that stores Docker images. **It can be compared to Github — you can pull an image from the registry to deploy it locally, and push locally built images to the registry.**
 * Docker Hub — a registry with web interface provided by Docker Inc. **It stores a lot of Docker images with different software. Docker Hub is a source of the “official” Docker images made by the Docker team or in cooperation with the original software manufacturer (it doesn’t necessary mean that these “original” images are from official software manufacturers).** Official images list their potential vulnerabilities. This information is available to any logged-in user. **There are both free and paid accounts available. You can have one private image per account and an infinite amount of public images for free.** Also there is a Docker Store — a service very similar to Docker Hub. It’s a marketplace with ratings, reviews, etc. My personal opinion is that it’s marketing stuff. I’m totally happy with Docker Hub.

- MongoDB
- Redis
  * Redis provides access to mutable data structures via a set of commands, which are sent using a server-client model with TCP sockets and a simple protocol. So different processes can query and modify the same data structures in a shared way.
