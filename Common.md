 * The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas,
  are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one
  compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second
  is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together,
  and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at
  once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of
  relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that
  accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction,
  and thus all its general ideas are made.

â€”John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)

* Real-world programming, however, requires
  care, expertise, and wisdom. A small bug in a computer-aided design
  program, for example, can lead to the catastrophic collapse of an airplane
  or a dam or the self-destruction of an industrial robot.
  
* Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:
   - - - -
  **primitive expressions**, which represent the simplest entities the language
   is concerned with,
   - - - -
  **means of combination**, by which compound elements are built from
   simpler ones, and
   - - - -
  **means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and
  manipulated as units.
