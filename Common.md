 * The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas,
  are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one
  compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second
  is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together,
  and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at
  once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of
  relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that
  accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction,
  and thus all its general ideas are made.

—John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)

* a leading teacher of the sixteenth-century Tzfat rationalist-kabbalist school, explained the need and the parameters of originality in [Kabbalah](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1567567/jewish/Kabbalah.htm):

  The Book of Formation says, “Understand with wisdom; be wise with understanding.” 

  “Understand with wisdom” means to investigate well whatever your teacher has taught you in the wisdom of the modalities. After all, in these matters we only transmit a bare outline. From that outline, each person must understand one idea from another.

  You can see this in the words of our sages when they said, Yet then it says, “be wise with understanding.” This means that when you originate and analyze with your intellect so that you may understand, you must take care to conceive the idea and explain it within the framework of the tradition of the rabbis and their terse words. The original ideas must be included in that which you have gained, whether much or little.

  “This matter is told only to a sage who understands with his own mind.” From this, you see that a person must use his own mind to compare one thing to another, and thereby extract one idea from within the other. That way he will have a procreative mind and not a barren one.

* Real-world programming, however, requires
  care, expertise, and wisdom. A small bug in a computer-aided design
  program, for example, can lead to the catastrophic collapse of an airplane
  or a dam or the self-destruction of an industrial robot.
  
* Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:
   - - - -
  **primitive expressions**, which represent the simplest entities the language
   is concerned with,
   - - - -
  **means of combination**, by which compound elements are built from
   simpler ones, and
   - - - -
  **means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and
  manipulated as units.

### Project management
### System environment
  * There is a body of software, in fact, that is responsible for making it
easy to run programs (even allowing you to seemingly run many at the
same time), allowing programs to share memory, enabling programs to
interact with devices, and other fun stuff like that. That body of software 
is called the operating system (OS), as it is in charge of making sure the
system operates correctly and efficiently in an easy-to-use manner.

  * A typical OS, in fact, exports
a few hundred system calls that are available to applications. Because
the OS provides these calls to run programs, access memory and devices,
and other related actions, we also sometimes say that the OS provides a
standard library to applications.

  * Finally, because virtualization allows many programs to run (thus sharing
the CPU), and many programs to concurrently access their own instructions
and data (thus sharing memory), andmany programs to access
devices (thus sharing disks and so forth), the OS is sometimes known as
a resource manager. Each of the **CPU, memory, and disk** is a resource
of the system; it is thus the operating system’s role to manage those resources,
doing so efficiently or fairly or indeed with many other possible
goals in mind.

  * Container — a running instance that encapsulates required software. Containers are always created from images. **A container can expose ports and volumes to interact with other containers or/and the outer world. Containers can be easily killed / removed and re-created again in a very short time. Containers don’t keep state.**
  * Image — **the basic element for every container. When you create an image, every step is cached and can be reused (Copy On Write model). Depending on the image, it can take some time to build.** Containers, on the other hand, can be started from images right away.
  * Port — **a TCP/UDP port in its original meaning. To keep things simple, let’s assume that ports can be exposed to the outer world (accessible from the host OS) or connected to other containers** — i.e., accessible only from those containers and invisible to the outer world.
  * Volume — can be described as a shared folder. **Volumes are initialized when a container is created. Volumes are designed to persist data, independent of the container’s lifecycle.** Registry — the server that stores Docker images. **It can be compared to Github — you can pull an image from the registry to deploy it locally, and push locally built images to the registry.**
  * Docker Hub — a registry with web interface provided by Docker Inc. **It stores a lot of Docker images with different software. Docker Hub is a source of the “official” Docker images made by the Docker team or in cooperation with the original software manufacturer (it doesn’t necessary mean that these “original” images are from official software manufacturers).** Official images list their potential vulnerabilities. This information is available to any logged-in user. **There are both free and paid accounts available. You can have one private image per account and an infinite amount of public images for free.** Also there is a Docker Store — a service very similar to Docker Hub. It’s a marketplace with ratings, reviews, etc. My personal opinion is that it’s marketing stuff. I’m totally happy with Docker Hub.

- Windows server
- Linux
- SQL server
- MongoDB
- Redis
  * Redis provides access to mutable data structures via a set of commands, which are sent using a server-client model with TCP sockets and a simple protocol. So different processes can query and modify the same data structures in a shared way.
